# Genesis

## Introduction

Genesis is a mobile app built on Flet framework. The app uses Github's API to search for the top repositories of the specified Programming languages.
The app is very easy to use and understand, there are 2 options i.e

**Option 1**

In this page you can provide atmost 6 programming languages. The app will plot a graph that will compare all the top repositories -based on stars- of the specified languages and give you a brief description of the repository, with a hyperlink to the official repository.

**Option 2**

In this page you can specify any programming language and the app will plot a graph of top 10 repositories -based on stars- of the language, with a brief description and a hyperlink to the official repository.

## Code

1. You can access the codes for the application in the [main.py](https://github.com/Prajwal01406/Genesis-Flet/blob/main/main.py) file.

2. The [assets](https://github.com/Prajwal01406/Genesis-Flet/tree/main/assets) contains all the necessary images.

3. The [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Prajwal01406/Genesis-Flet/blob/main/requirements.txt.txt) specifies all the required modules and libraries.

4. building a python environment is recommended before importing the files into your computer.

# Note

As Flet doesn't work well for multi paged applications and runs into errors, I have decided not to build an apk.

To solve this and to make the app available on mobile devices, I will be using another frame work (**kivy**) to build another version of this app and build apk.
